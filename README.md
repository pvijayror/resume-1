This is my resume in txt and pdf formats.

I never liked my resume in `doc` format because the formatting was so finicky and required I edit it on windows to make sure it would look okay universally.  I like the plain `txt` format better, but it looks pretty plain.

I've been getting comfortable with prawn recently, so I decided to write a quick script that parses my txt resume and generates a simple pdf version.

The resume data is pulled from the text version using a simple handwritten "parser", instead of being stored in YAML or some data format, which I find nicer.

To generate the pdf, just run `ruby resume.rb`
