This is my resume in txt and pdf formats.

I never liked my resume in `.doc` format because the formatting was so finicky and required I edit it on windows to make sure the formatting looked okay.  I like the plain `txt` format better, but it could look a little fancier.  

I've been getting comfortable with prawn recently, so I decided to write a quick script that parses my txt resume and generates a simple pdf version.

I prefer writing a simple custom parser to pull the data out of a text file than to storing the data in YAML or some data format and generating the text version as well.
